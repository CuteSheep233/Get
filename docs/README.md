## What it is?

It was a long time ago that I found someone manage to build a tool that can download official Google Chrome offline installer by fetching Google Chrome's download request.

I love the idea! I used Chrome a lot and because of the Internet restrict in my country, people cannot use Google services well. In which case, Chrome offline installer could be quite useful!

But my technique is so poor, even though the original author of the tool that I just mentioned gave me so many helps, I still couldn't manage to build a similar one.

Until one day, I found there is actually a unpublished official link that can download Chrome directly! So I said, "Oh, I just got the things sorted!"

And a few days ago, I suddenly realised that there are so many apps and software, things like that, can be directly downloaded! Without Googling the official websites and clicking the download bottoms every single time that you want something installed. So, I asked a few of my friends and they think it was a great idea! So here we are! 

To be honest HXCO Get is based on really simple principle: use JavaScript to identify user's Operating System, then we fetch the official download APIs manually and post it onto our services! All you need to do is type `https://get.hxco.de/{app name}` into your browser then press Enter! 

## Features

- Simplify type in a link and press enter, download process will be done automatically.
- Scan the QR Code on the download page, get the mobile app (if there is one) on your phone.
- Always downloading the latest app.
- Fast access speed.
- Easy to maintain.
